Every programming language has its own tools to give the programmer the power to perform an idea.
In this article we take C++ as the programming language and callback as idea to perform, also gmock for a way to test our code.
Callback in real life, you call someone, they can not answer at that moment for any reason, you request for a callback so that they call you in a later time.
In programming languages, the concept of 'callback function' (lets name is callMeBack())is a function which is argument of another function (lets name it func()).
As part of its body, func() will call callMeBack() sometime.
There are 2 types of callbacks, blocking ones (synchronous) and deferred ones (asynchronous). Difference is blocking ones are called before the caller function returns so the caller actually waits for them to finish their job.
In C++, lambda and function pointers support this concept. They can be stored, copied and invoked by a general-purpose function wrapper, std::function.

A simple example of std::fucntion below:

#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

void callMeBack(int x)
{
  std::cout << x << std::endl;
}

void func(std::function<void(int)> callback)
{
  int knownValueAtThisPoint = 11;
  callback(knownValueAtThisPoint);
}

int main() 
{
  std::function<void(int)> callLater = callMeBack;
  callLater(5);
  
  
  func(callLater);
  return 0;
}
